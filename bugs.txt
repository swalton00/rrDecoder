1. If the local drive is read-only, the program starts but any write operation fails. Opening
    the database also fails. The program continues to run. The exception at that point
    should cause the program to terminate with an error message - perhaps with an OKay dialog?
        2/1/26 - Part of the problem is that Log4J doesn't support a UNC file



xx2. Road "Number" needs to allow alpha characters (database change).
    fixed PR#1

3. Potentially related to 1) above - under certain circumstances (which ones?) the
    display is off screen or too large (or perhaps, too small).
    2/1/26 - if no properties file, main display is too large and not properly formatted

4. Need to better allow for executing with a double click, rather than from a command line.

5. DOC -- folder location of .bat file for execution.

6. DOC -- doc to setup for network access to H2?

7. Select database location header says "Select Ops Pro Home location"

8. bug in settings - if url doesn't contain schema, it uses URL as schema name
    (Attempts to extract schema from URL even it doesn't contain it).
