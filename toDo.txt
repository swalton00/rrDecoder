Bugs:
    When saving a new database, schema is not tested
    When saving the preferences, a new schema is not saved
    On startup, if database exists, doesn't correctly check for tables
        Checks if DB_Version exists, doesn't check for rest of tables
    Doesn't work if URL doesn't include SCHEMA=xx
