= RRDecoder Documentation

== Introduction
This is the documentation for the Model Railroad Decoder Database program. The purpose of the
program is to store one or more JMRI "rosters", and all the the locomotives listed therein (including
their CV values. If you only have one JMRI instance containing decoders, that's fine -- you will only see the
one line in the main roster view, but you can drill down into that roster.

If you have more than one JMRI instance, you can add each of them to this database. They  will remain
distinct, but you can compare the values of a CV in one against those in another.
