Release 1.0.5

1. Fixed the initial size issue.

2. Fixed several bugs in initial setup.

    BREAKING Change -- The "SCHEMA=" in no longer allowed in the URL to the database.
        If it is set in the saved database URL, on startup the application will display the
        preferences dialog. You must manually remove the ":SCHEMA=" from the URL and click SAVE.

3. Several changes were made to better handle a network database. Specifically, "Import Detail"
    is only enabled for the main (roster list) if all rosters were on imported on the current system.
    For the decoder list, Import Detail is only enabled if all decoders are from roster(s) imported
    on the local system.

4. The name of the distribution zip or tar file is "decoderDB" (without the version number).
    This will simplify upgrading in the future. For this release, remove the "app-1.0.2" directory
    and unzip or untar the current zip into the now empty folder.
